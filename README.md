# Online Retail Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing online retail data. It covers data preprocessing, data cleansing, and cohort analysis. The project utilizes Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/online-retail-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd online-retail-analysis
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis

## Data

The project uses an Online Retail dataset from a CSV file. The dataset contains information about orders, products, customers, and more.

## Data Preprocessing and Cleansing

- Conversion of date columns to datetime format.
- Creation of a `year_month` column for better time analysis.
- Removal of rows with missing `customer_id` and `product_name`.
- Standardization of product names to lowercase.
- Removal of rows with test product codes or names.
- Categorization of orders into "cancelled" and "delivered."
- Conversion of negative quantities to positive.
- Elimination of rows with negative prices.
- Computation of the `amount` column as the product of quantity and price.
- Handling of ambiguous product names based on frequency.

## Cohort Analysis

- Aggregation of transaction data into a summary of total orders per user per month.
- Cohort assignment for each user based on their first transaction month.
- Calculation of the number of months between each transaction month and the first transaction (cohort).
- Construction of a pivot table with retention rates for each cohort.
